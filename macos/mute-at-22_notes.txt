Initially:

launchctl load "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rwgk.mute-at-22.plist"


You can check that it’s loaded:

launchctl list | grep mute-at-22


If you later change the plist, run:

launchctl unload "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rwgk.mute-at-22.plist"
launchctl load   "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rwgk.mute-at-22.plist"


You can trigger it manually via launchctl to be sure it works end-to-end:

launchctl start com.rwgk.mute-at-22

Your Mac should mute; if anything’s off, check:

cat "$HOME/Library/Logs/mute-at-22.log"
cat "$HOME/Library/Logs/mute-at-22.err"
